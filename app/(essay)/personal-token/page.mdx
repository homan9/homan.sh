## what it is

A personal token represents the value a person creates over their life.

Its value is grounded in its owner's profits when they sell equity in companies, personal tokens, and similar instruments. 

Holding shares in a personal token is a proportional claim to these gains. This is strictly an *economic* claim; it doesn't come with ownership / control / influence over the token owner in any way.

By sharing equity in their personal token, a person can incentivize others to help them create value at the level of life – beyond any single idea, and across everything they may ever do.

## representation

At its core, a personal token is an *agreement*, and the information and functionality required to honor that agreement.

A personal token is represented on a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) so that its state, mechanics, agreements and amendments are transparent and verifiable.

Since a personal token is an agreement at its core, its onchain state can be reconciled with the truth. For example, if a shareholder loses their onchain wallet, the token owner can update the personal token to reflect the shareholder's new wallet address.

## how it works

The token owner has full control over liquidity. They can enable free trading within a curated group. They can pause trading at their discretion.

Key mechanics (defined as onchain functions):

- **Floor** – the amount excluded from the scope of my token.
- **Buybacks** – the token owner can buy back shares from shareholders at any time, but the minimum buyback price is determined by an onchain function, not by the token owner in the moment of buyback.
- **Royalties** – the token owner gets a small royalty in shares on the profit a shareholder makes when they sell.
- **Voting** – shareholders vote on whether capital gains are distributed to shareholders or reinvested back into the token owner to fuel growth. Votes are weighted by shares held. The token owner doesn't vote. Like companies, shareholders will mostly profit through secondary sales, not distributions.

Any changes to the personal token (mechanics, the agreement, etc.) require every shareholder to approve. This is because any change is a change to what they agreed to when they came onboard.

One of the reasons buybacks exist is for alignment. As the token evolves through amendments, token owners need the ability to buy back shares from those who don't agree with a change. Buybacks also exist for the evolution of the village, which I'll discuss next.
