# Trading as feedback from reality

Trading shares in my personal token provides invaluable feedback from reality.

How many shares of my token a villager (i.e, someone with permission to trade my shares) buys or sells, when, and at which price, signals their feedback on my judgement with a notion of degree that I don't have access to today.

The quality of my village determines quality of feedback from trading my shares. If my village is disconnected from reality, then they are likely to double down when they should be shorting me, and vice versa.

Curation is everything. The higher quality the village, the more seriously I will take their trading feedback. If my village starts to short me after I announce a decision, I will think more deeply before acting on it. The higher quality (and size) my village becomes, the faster I can move since I know if I make a big mistake, they will quickly let me know through trading.
