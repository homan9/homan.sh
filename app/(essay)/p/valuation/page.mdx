<ValuationScene />

Alice is a bright 18-year-old living in San Francisco. She makes content for a startup. She has a natural curiosity and drive to tell great stories that move people. She uses AI to amplify her storytelling. She is cheerful, optimistic, yet grounded. How would you value Alice's personal token?

> A personal token represents the net profit its owner makes over their life from selling equity in companies, other personal tokens, and similar instruments – above a floor ( portion of profits excluded from shareholder claims). [Learn more](/my-personal-token).

Your first instinct might be to look at what Alice has today – her current work, her current holdings. This is her present potential, and it sets the minimum value of her token: what we believe her current holdings are worth, minus her floor.

But the real value of Alice's token lies in what she hasn't yet discovered – the ideas and collaborations that will emerge over the course of her life. Her *future* potential is what determines her token's valuation.

How do we value future potential?

It's tempting to answer this question in the context of our present world. For example, you may try to gauge the chance of Alice going on to start or work at startups vs. becoming a feature filmmaker. These paths, in our present world, have drastically different business models. Without exposure to startup economics, a person's token won't be worth much.

But, if you believe the world is about to change drastically, then it makes sense to first think about how the world will change, and then work backwards to see how Alice may do in the future. **How you value a personal token reflects your beliefs about how the world will change.**

My beliefs:

1. **Leverage.** AI will drastically amplify an individual's judgment. We will see an explosion in the number of ideas a person brings to the world.
2. **Extreme outcomes.** With greater leverage, the gap between the best and the average will increase sharply. Startup economics (extreme upside, power-law distributions) will emerge in everything we do[^churn].
3. **Convergence.** AI strips away the operational complexities that keep domains separate, leaving the transferable core: judgment, taste, understanding people, etc. Someone with a strong core can operate across domains as barriers to entry collapse. Labels become useless.
4. **Tokenization.** As extreme outcomes emerge across more activities, we will securitize them to share risk and reward more broadly. Startup-like instruments – tokens – will eat the world.
5. **Exponential.** This decade will bring more change than the past century.

As extreme outcomes emerge everywhere, Alice will be exposed to extreme upside opportunities regardless of whether she joins a startup. Her ability to move people through stories will transfer across domains as AI strips away the operational barriers between them, expanding her opportunity surface area. Through tokenization, Alice will be able to capture the value she creates. And she has decades of exponential growth ahead of her.

But there's still great risk. In a world with great leverage and convergence, Alice has to be special to stand out. If she doesn't embrace what makes her unique, the person(s) she is mimicking will make her work irrelevant very quickly. Such courage isn't easy. And Alice may quit entirely for whatever reason.

Even so, if I notice a hint of something special in Alice's work, something that reflects what makes her unique, something that moves me – I would value her personal token at $1B at the least. We already value promising pre-revenue startups at $1B or more. Alice has a transferable core skill, an exploding number of ideas to apply it across, and decades ahead of her in an exponentially accelerating world. Why would her potential be worth any less?

But there's a critical factor that we haven't taken into account yet.

Behind every great individual success, there are many supporters who made it possible. Personal tokens enable supporters to capture the value they help create[^supporters].

If Alice surrounds herself with bright people, and has genuine skill in supporting their success, she will earn equity in their tokens and gain access to their circles, compounding her exposure to extreme upside.

Therefore, we can't view Alice's potential in isolation. She is a node in a network. Her skill in choosing who she spends time with, and how well she can support them, is the greatest factor in her valuation – contributing orders of magnitude more than her individual potential alone[^blend].

Now, I think it's impossible for anyone's personal token to be valued what I think they are genuinely worth any time soon. We tend to be quite skeptical of new instruments. Even companies in their early days were rarely valued much beyond their current profits. It took time to understand and trust the instrument itself.

We are also slow to adapt to reality. We sorely underestimate AI's impact *even when we take into account that we sorely underestimate it*. It will take us some time to align our intuitions with reality. But the market always catches up.

[^churn]: I believe extreme outcomes will be dynamic (lot of churn). The best will find it increasingly difficult to remain the best. We are seeing early signs in top startups today. There has never been a more vulnerable set of top startups.

[^supporters]: Our world is quite unfair in this way. Personal tokens will help combat extreme wealth concentration by giving more people exposure to the extreme upsides – reflecting the truth that it takes a lot of help to enable individual success.

[^blend]: And I think this surfaces a deeper point: an individual's potential *is* their potential to impact their network. There is actually no difference between the two. Even individual genius is only considered "genius" if it impacts many others (the network).
